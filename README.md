# please-play-list
A School project.
I want to create an API, that works a bit like a bookmarker but for music.
As a user you would login and be able to go to different urls find the music you want.
you would be able to create playlists and add those urls to the chosen playlist.
pick between your created playlists, add new songs, remove old ones or remove the playlist entirely.
maybe a autogenerated unique playlist id, so you can share playlists by making them public or giving a friend the playlist id.
